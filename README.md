# etc-programs

Random programs that I have made throughout my time.

## Current program list:

### Basic Farm ([basic-farm.lua](basic-farm.lua))
A very simple farming program that just spins on the spot and farms the block in
around it. Due to its nature, it does not need fuel to run. Just let it go with
a couple of seeds, and it should be fine. Come back every now and then and
collect your crops.
